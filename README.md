# hydrodynamic-focusing
This is a Matlab code for theoretical simulation of hydrodynamic focusing in rectangular microfluidic channels. The simulation is based on the following paper:
[Lee, Gwo-Bin, Chih-Chang Chang, Sung-Bin Huang, and Ruey-Jen Yang. "The hydrodynamic focusing effect inside rectangular microchannels." Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering 16, no. 5 (2006): 1024.](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0960-1317/16/5/020/meta)
The code generates fluid velocity distribution inside the channel, the width of the sample flow, and the settings for the pump infusion rate based on the channel width and height.
